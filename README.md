# Javascript-Maniac - Day 04
## Switch Statement
The <strong>`switch`</strong> statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
A <strong>switch</strong> statement can replace multiple if checks and it usually used, when we have to check multiple `if else` conditions. 

It gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants.

## Syntax

The `switch` has one or more `case` blocks and an optional default.

```
switch(x) {
  case 'value1':  // if (x === 'value1')
    ...
    [break]

  case 'value2':  // if (x === 'value2')
    ...
    [break]

  default:
    ...
    [break]
}
```
## How it Works

* The switch expression is evaluated once.
* The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
* If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
