# Javascript-Maniac
As, there are many of my friends & developers who have asked me to teach JavaScript. Here's how i will do it. I am starting an Initiative for creating <b>JavaScript</b> Tutorials for those, who really want to learning JavaScript.

In this course, I will do cover JavaScript topics from basics to advanced for 100 days as it will be my <b>#100DaysOfCode</b> challenge as well,so nothing could be better for me to teach & contribute at the same time. 

I will create branch for every topic i cover.

If you want to access code:

You just have to follow these steps:

1) :octocat: Fork this github repository by typing in command propmt `git clone https://github.com/Mohammad-Quanit/Javascript-Maniac.git`.

2) :octocat: Checkout or switch to branch of topic you want to get code for `git checkout day01-Js-Basics`

You can suggest anything you want like how it should be or not.
