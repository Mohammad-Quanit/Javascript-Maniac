# Javascript-Maniac - Day 01
As, this is day one of our class 1, I will describe what Javascript is, how it can be major technology for web and advantages of JavaScript & why should you use it for you projects. Now i am assuming that you have knowledge of HTML & CSS.

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time compiled, object-oriented programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Now you might be Confusing What these terms means? Don't worry I will breifly explain, what these terms means in the next tutorials as we cover. 

But for now, I will tell how to start immediately learning <b>Javascript</b>

### Day - 01 Code Explanation
In this code, i have created html file named `index.html` and javascript file named `app.js`. <br />
I have linked or connected my Javascript file to html by using `<script src="./app.js"></script>`.  <br />
I have created an html element `<h1>` with an id of `header-1` & now i am going to show header from javascript.  <br />
Now in `app.js` file, I have created a variable `var h1 = document.getElementById('header-1');` and get the reference of html header in js. Now i am changing the content of header by js using `h1.innerText = "This is Header coming from Javascript";` <br />

Now what it will do it will change text of header by Javascript using `DOM` api.  <br />
DOM stands from Document Object Model which is basically a tree like structure in your web page for managing HTML Elements.
